Imagine a friend asked you for something, or sent you a link or a video, but you don't have time to process that right at the moment.

`telegram2org` is a tool that allows you to add a TODO item to your org-mode file in one action: forwarding the message you want to remember about to a special private channel, so you keep your focus while not being mean ignoring your friends' messages.

See `config.py.example` for configuring.
